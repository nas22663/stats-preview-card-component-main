## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

learned a lot of things about flexbox columns and rows still a bit of learning to do in that area
but i liked how easy it was when i wanted to change from desktop to mobile all i had to do for the main style is to change from a row to colum in flex direction

```
body {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
```


### Continued development

i want to try more projects with flexbox to practice a bit more

### Useful resources

- [santu369 on the project](https://github.com/santu369/frontendmentor-stats-preview-card-component) - i know its kinda cheating but i wanted to understand a bit more and this was helpful didn't copy anything though just tried to understand how he proceeded with the project to understand.
